Ugly Bash scripts to monitor Camelot Unchained's XMPP chat server

These are functional, but very ugly and resource intensive scripts. They are being replaced by cu-chatbot written in Node.js. I've added these to Github simply for future reference. I do not recommend using these.

Requires:
 - OSX (last used with version 10.10.4)
 - Adium (last used with version 1.5.10)
 - Messages app
 - Pushover account
 - Camelot Unchained account
